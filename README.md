# Parallel-Delta-Robot

This code made in  Matlab-Simulink corresponds to the identified dynamic model of a parallel robotic manipulator type delta presented in the paper Fractional order PID for tracking control of a parallel robotic
manipulator type delta. To run the code just download all the files in the same folder and execute the file identTestCode.m. The simulation is performed using simulink and is performed in open-loop. Therefore 
you can add the closed loop control strategy of your preference.
